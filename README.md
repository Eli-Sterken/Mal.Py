Welcome to the Mal.Py repository!

This is a repository for the program I made called Mal.Py. 

It will download malware from Malware Bazar based on a tag imputed by you, and save it to any location. It can also execute the malware with a variety of analysis options and settings as well.

Please note that malware is malicious software, and can harm your computer and cause data loss. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this software.

Thank you for visiting, and happy research!
